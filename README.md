**Automated Boot Image Signing Script for Unisoc Chipset-Based Phones** 

## What is this script for ‚ùì
This script automates the process of signing Unisoc/Spreadtrum (SPD) boot images using a private key and AVBTool, following the instructions in this [**Tutorial**](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32674.html) from hovatek.

Included in the BIScript zip are a custom-signed vbmeta image based on this [**Tutorial**](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32664.html) and an OpenSSL-generated custom boot signing (.pem) key based on this [**Tutorial**](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32662.html).

Newer Unisoc chip-based phones require you to sign and flash the Magisk-patched boot image directly; otherwise, the device may enter a bootloop. This is because devices equipped with vbmeta-sign demand a customized signed vbmeta before tampering with protected partitions. Thus, I've created this script to simplify the rooting process and aid others in need. Additionally, I've developed a [boot-image-flasher](https://github.com/gitclone-url/Boot-img-flasher) script for directly flashing the signed boot image.

**Noteüìú**: You must have a rooted environment to use the boot-image-flasher script.

This BIScript has been tested on the following four devices:

- Micromax in 2b / Micromax in 2c (Indian brand)
- Symphony z33 / Symphony z45 (Bangladeshi brand)

All these devices rely on the Unisoc Tiger T610 chip and share many similarities. They all include vbmeta-sign.img in their firmware, as these devices exclusively accept images signed with keys matching the contents of the device's vbmeta partition.

## How to use this script ‚ùì

**For detailed instructions on setting up and using the script, please follow this [Script Setup Guide](https://github.com/gitclone-url/BIScript/blob/Master/Script%20Setup%20Guide.md).**

## Additional Info üìú

My primary goal in creating this script was to support the four devices I mentioned earlier. I cannot guarantee its compatibility with other Unisoc chipset-based phones, as some OEMs employ a private (.pem) key for signing partitions, even for bootloader unlocking. If you wish to use this script on your phone, you'll need to make these modifications:

1. Modify the `cmd` command as follows:
   
   ```python
   cmd = [
       "python2", "avbtool", "add_hash_footer", "--image", "boot.img", "--partition_name", "boot",
       "--partition_size", "67108864", "--key", "boot.pem", "--algorithm", "SHA256_RSA4096",
       "--prop", f"com.android.build.boot.fingerprint:{fingerprint}",
       "--prop", "com.android.build.boot.os_version:11"
   ]
   ```

2. Adapt the `Partition size` and `Algorithm` values in the `cmd` command to match your boot image information.

3. Create a custom-signed vbmeta using this [Tutorial](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32664.html). You can use [Vbmeta Keys Extractor](https://github.com/Fijxu/VBMetaKeysExtractor-Linux) for this task.

4. If you lack a private key to sign images, you can use the vbmeta-sign image provided in the zip. Most Unisoc OEMs employ the same keys for vbmeta signing. If my vbmeta works on your phone, you can use the `boot.pem` key from the zip to sign your boot image as well.
